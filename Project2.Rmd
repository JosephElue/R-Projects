```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


SECTION 1 

Question 1

Set your working directory for this assignment.

```{r}
#setwd("C:")
```

Question 2

Download the data

```{r}
autompg = read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data",quote = "\"", comment.char = "", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(autompg)

str(autompg)

df <- autompg
```

Question 3

Go to the website and change the column names with the correct ones

```{r}
colnames(df)

names(df)[names(df) == "V1"] <- "mpg"
names(df)[names(df) == "V2"] <- "cylinders"
names(df)[names(df) == "V3"] <- "displacement"
names(df)[names(df) == "V4"] <- "horsepower"
names(df)[names(df) == "V5"] <- "weight"
names(df)[names(df) == "V6"] <- "acceleration"
names(df)[names(df) == "V7"] <- "model_year"
names(df)[names(df) == "V8"] <- "origin"
names(df)[names(df) == "V9"] <- "car_name"
```

Question 4

Check the data and correct the class (Factor, Int, Num, etc.) of each column to an appropriate one, if
necessary

```{r}
# Convert HP to numeric because the loop converts it to factor hence it doesn't count the Na's as Na's
df$horsepower <- as.numeric(df$horsepower)

# I converted these to factors because they signify difference types of cars and not necessarily a numeric increase. 
df$cylinders <- as.factor(df$cylinders)
df$origin <- as.factor(df$origin)

# Covert the remaining variables appropriately
for (i in 1:ncol(df)) {
  if(is.character(df[,i])) df[,i] <- as.factor(df[,i])
}

# Proof of conversion
str(df)
```

Question 5

How many missing values do we have in the data?

```{r}
# Is there any NA in the data
anyNA(df$horsepower)

# Find the sum of these NA's 
sum(is.na(df))

```
Question 6 

Identify the number of NA’s in each column.

```{r}
# Given Code
r <- sapply(df, function(x) length(which(is.na(x))))
r

# Alternative Code
colSums(is.na(df))

# This would present the results in a list format
r <- lapply(df, function(x) length(which(is.na(x))))
r
```
Question 7 

What’s the mean of hp in our data? If you are not able to get a number, why? How would you solve
this problem? Hint: na.rm in mean()

```{r}
mean_hp <- mean(df$horsepower, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_hp
```
Question 8 

What are the row and column index numbers for those NA’s in your data. Call that matrix ind.

```{r}
ind <- which(is.na(df), arr.ind = TRUE)
ind

```
Question 9

Now, we will handle NA’s with several different ways

```{r}
# Assign data to a different name 
df2 <- df

# Replace these Na's with the conditional mean of hp of the corresponding origin
# Proof of NA before replacement
anyNA(df2$horsepower)

# Replacement
df2$horsepower[is.na(df2$horsepower)] <- with(df2, ave(df2$horsepower, df2$origin, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)))

# Proof of removed NA after replacement
anyNA(df2$horsepower)
```

Question 9b 

Remove NA’s and show the dimension of new data.

```{r}
# Dimension of data before removing Na's
dim(df)


# Remove Na's
df <- df[complete.cases(df), ] 

# Dimension of data after removing Na's 
dim(df)
```


SECTION 2 

Question 1 

Plot mpg vs. hp, mpg vs. disp, mpg vs. acc. Put these three graphs next to each other. Use titles and
different colors in each. Change the axis labels as well. Hint look at par() and mfcol(). Make sure
that labels are not too large, otherwise adjust them

```{r}
par(mfcol = c(1, 3))
plot(x = df$mpg, y = df$horsepower,cex = .5, col = "dark red", xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Horsepower", main = "MPG vs Horsepower")
plot(x = df$mpg, y = df$displacement,cex = .5, col = "red", xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Displacement", main = "MPG vs Displacement")
plot(x = df$mpg, y = df$acceleration,cex = .5, col = "dark blue", xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Acceleration", main = "MPG vs Acceleration")

```

Question 2 

Now, please get 6 plots (3 variables vs any other 3) in one plot.

```{r}
# Plotting three variables 
pairs(df[c(1, 3, 6)])

# Plotting six variables
pairs(cbind(df$mpg, df$displacement, df$horsepower, df$weight, df$acceleration, df$model_year))

```

Question 3

Try correlation plot with corrplot() and cor( ,use ="complete.obs"). You need the package corrplot.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
library(tidyverse)
df %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor(., use="complete.obs") %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot(., method="number") 

```


SECTION 3

Question 1

Use lm() to model 𝑚𝑝𝑔 = 𝑓(𝑥). Assign your estimations to model1. Calculate Training RMSPE. Remove NA before doing anything (use complete.cases()).
```{r}
# Remove Na's
df <- df[complete.cases(df), ]

# Data Split
ind <- sample(nrow(df), nrow(df)*0.7)
train <- df[ind,]
test <- df[-ind,]

# Model
model1 <- lm(train$mpg ~ ., data = train)

# Calculating RMPSE Train
phat <- predict(model1, train)
RMPSE_train <- sqrt(mean((train$mpg - phat)^2))
RMPSE_train
```
SECTION 4

Question 1

We now need to see test RMSPE. Split our sample into two random parts: train which has 70% of
the data and test which has the 30% of the data.

```{r}
# Remove NA's 
df <- df[complete.cases(df), ]

# Data Split
ind <- sample(nrow(df), nrow(df)*0.7)
train <- df[ind,]
test <- df[-ind,]

# Model: Car name was not included because it is a factor variable with a lot of levels hence it gives a error message when trying to find yhat.
model1 <- lm(train$mpg ~ cylinders + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration + model_year + origin, data = train)
yhat <- predict(model1, test)
yhat
```

Section 4

Question 2

Calculate the test RMSPE:

```{r}
RMPSE <- sqrt(mean((test$mpg - yhat)^2))
RMPSE
```

Section 4

Question 3

Run a loop that calculates the test RMSPE 1000 times and plot it

```{r}
# Loop 
RMPSE <- c()
df <- df[complete.cases(df), ]
for (i in 1:1000) {
  ind <- sample(nrow(df), nrow(df)*0.7)
  train <- df[ind,]
  test <- df[-ind,]
  model1 <- lm(train$mpg ~ displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration, data = train)
  yhat <- predict(model1, test)
  RMPSE[i] <- sqrt(mean((test$mpg - yhat)^2))
}

plot(RMPSE, col = "dark blue", main = "RMPSE PLOT")
abline(a=mean(RMPSE),b = 0, col = "red", lwd = 1)

```
